#  C - Search Algorithms
This directory contains my tasks on search algorithms

Searching is the fundamental process of locating a specific element or item within a collection of data.

These algorithms are designed to efficiently navigate through data structures to find the desired information, making them fundamental in various applications such as databases, web search engines, and more.

**Search Space:**
The search space refers to the entire collection of data within which you are looking for the target element. Depending on the data structure used, the search space may vary in size and organization.

**Complexity:**
Searching can have different levels of complexity depending on the data structure and the algorithm used. The complexity is often measured in terms of time and space requirements.

**Deterministic vs. Non-deterministic:**
Some searching algorithms, like binary search, are deterministic, meaning they follow a clear, systematic approach. Others, such as linear search, are non-deterministic, as they may need to examine the entire search space in the worst case.


The two major search algorithms in this project are:
- **Binary search** is a search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty. The search interval is halved by comparing the target element with the middle value of the search space.

- **Linear Search** is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. In this article, we will learn about the basics of Linear Search Algorithm, Applications, Advantages, Disadvantages, etc. to provide a deep understanding of Linear Search.
