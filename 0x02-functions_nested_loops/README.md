# Nested loops

A nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement. That is why nested loops are also called “loop inside loops“. We can define any number of loops inside another loop.
Below is the equivalent flow diagram for nested ‘for’ loops:

**syntax**
```
for ( initialization; condition; increment ) {

   for ( initialization; condition; increment ) {
      
      // statement of inside loop
   }

   // statement of outer loop
}
```
