# Preprocessor

Preprocessors are programs that process the source code before compilation. Several steps are involved between writing a program and executing a program in C.

Preprocessor programs provide preprocessor directives that tell the compiler to preprocess the source code before compiling. All of these preprocessor directives begin with a **‘#’** (hash) symbol. The ‘#’ symbol indicates that whatever statement starts with a ‘#’ will go to the preprocessor program to get executed.
